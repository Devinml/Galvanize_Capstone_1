## Background
Wheather you are a passionate mountainbike racer or have just started, you know that mountain bikes are expensive. A new mountain bike that has high enough quality components to race is going to range from $4500-8000. This being said, you might think to buy a second hand bike. In the world of mountain bikes there are two wheeel sizes, 27.5"  and 29". The difference between these two is a trade-off between speed and manouverability. A 29" bike will be faster do to its ability to roll over obsticles. A 27.5" bike is going to be what is called "flickable" it can change direction easily at the cost of speed. I want to know wheater a 29" wheel bike is worth morth than a 27.5" in the used bike market. 

To answer this question I went to PinkBike.com's classifieds section where owners of mountain bikes can post their bike for sale to the mountain bike community.
